# Rick and Morty Database

This app is a prototype of a database where one may access a list of all characters, all episodes and all locations from the show. 
- When a character is clicked, a modal opens with more info.
- When an episode is clicked, a modal opens with all characters in the episode.
- It has pagination through Material UI.

This app was created with NextJS and consumes the Rick and Morty API through Axios.
