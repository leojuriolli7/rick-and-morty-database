This app is a prototype of a database where one may access a list of all characters, all episodes and all locations from the show. 
- When a character is clicked, a modal opens with their status, species, gender, origin, current location and the first and last episode they appeared in.
- When an episode is clicked, a modal opens with all characters present in the episode.
- When a location is clicked, a modal opens with all residents from that location.

This app was created with NextJS and consumes the Rick and Morty API through Axios. It has pagination through Material UI and a Search Input to find specific characters.

The app accessible through Heroku:
